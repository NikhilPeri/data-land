# Purpose
Dataland is a place where you can easily schedule jobs to perform any data processing task
at a "Hacker scale".  Without the need for costly cloud computing resources, dataland schedules
recurring jobs to run on your local machine during those extra clock cycles.

It is a great tool to run recurring data processing tasks with support for incremental
datasets
